<h2 class= "text-center">About Glen</h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of Toledo with a Bachelor's in Interdisciplinary Studies. Started working for Owens Corning in 2017 working in the Supply Chain. On the side, I spent time as a photographer. Growing and building my own website, I realized how much I liked building my own websites.</p>

<p> I became a student at Thinkful where I've begun my path to becoming a software developer</p>

  <p> If you're looking for a new developer, I would love to connect! I am looking forward to working with others towards new goals. </p>
